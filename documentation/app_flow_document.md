# Study4Me App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user opens the Study4Me landing page, they are greeted by a bold Neobrutalist design featuring bright yellow blocks and thick black outlines. A prompt invites them to connect their wallet using either Web3Auth or WalletConnect. After selecting their preferred wallet method and approving the connection, the app automatically checks for the required Study4Me NFT on the Base or Arbitrum network. If the NFT is not detected, the user is guided through a simple on-chain purchase process where they confirm a transaction in their wallet to mint or buy the NFT. Once the NFT appears in their wallet, the platform allocates an initial bundle of study credits valid for three months. At this point, the user is fully signed in and redirected to the main dashboard.

Signing out is handled by clicking the profile icon in the header and selecting a "Disconnect Wallet" option, which safely logs the user out and returns them to the landing page. There is no traditional email or password to recover, so if a user loses access to their wallet, they must restore their wallet externally before reconnecting to Study4Me.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After successfully signing in, the user sees the Study4Me dashboard. At the top, a header displays their wallet address, current NFT status, remaining credit balance, and the expiry date of the credit bundle. Below this, key metrics appear in large, high-contrast cards: the total number of content ingestions, queries performed, and audio classes downloaded. On the left side, a vertical navigation bar with thick outlines offers quick access to the list of study topics, analytics, audio library, and account settings. A prominent "New Topic" button in neon blue invites the user to begin creating a study topic. The dashboard provides a clear snapshot of all ongoing work and makes it easy to jump into core features.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks "New Topic," they are taken to the Create Study Topic page, which asks for a name and optional areas of interest. The page then shows four input zones with clear labels: one for a YouTube link, one for dragging and dropping PDFs or documents, one for uploading images for OCR processing, and one for pasting webpage URLs to be scraped. Each area is outlined in black and filled with a vibrant background color that changes on hover.

After the user adds content and clicks "Submit for Ingestion," a full-screen modal overlays the app showing real-time progress bars for each pipeline. The backend uses Whisper to transcribe YouTube videos, Docling to parse PDFs and documents, Tesseract for image OCR, and a web scraper based on Trafilatura to cleanly extract text from URLs. As each asset completes processing, the result is pinned to IPFS and recorded on Arweave. The modal displays links to those storage hashes for transparency.

Once ingestion is finished, the "Build Graph" button becomes active. Clicking it transitions the user to the Knowledge Graph Viewer page. Here, a pan-and-zoom canvas renders nodes and edges representing entities, relationships, and context hierarchies. Color coding differentiates source types, and tooltips appear when hovering over nodes to show a brief description. There is no node editing, so the viewer remains read-only to preserve data integrity.

From the graph viewer, the user can switch to the Query Interface by clicking the query icon in the header. This page features a large input field labeled "Ask a question about your topic." The user types a question such as "How do zk-SNARKs compare to zk-STARKs?" and presses Enter. The response appears in a chat-style window below, along with highlighted nodes on the graph and citations showing document links or timestamps. The user can click any citation to open the original content in a side panel.

When the user wants an audio summary, they click the "Generate Audio Class" button on either the graph viewer or query page. A small status indicator appears next to the button while ElevenLabs synthesizes the audio. Once complete, the MP3 file is added to the userâ€™s Audio Library. They can stream the file directly or download it to their device for offline listening.

## Settings and Account Management
The user accesses account settings by clicking their profile icon in the dashboard header. The Account page shows wallet details, NFT ownership status, credit balance, and a button to purchase additional credits via an on-chain transaction on Base or Arbitrum. Below this, a Preferences section lets the user configure notification settings for ingestion completion, credit expiry reminders, and new audio class availability. All changes are saved with a single click on the "Save Preferences" button, and a brief confirmation message appears at the top of the page.

From any settings page, a "Back to Dashboard" link in the header returns users to the main dashboard so they can immediately continue their study workflow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user submits an invalid YouTube link, a PDF file over the size limit, or a malformed URL, a red error banner appears at the top of the ingestion page explaining the specific issue and prompting them to correct it. During the ingestion pipelines, if Whisper or Docling fails, the progress modal displays which step encountered the error and offers a "Retry" button. If storing to IPFS or Arweave is blocked by network issues or transaction failures, a notification appears advising the user to check their connection or wallet status, and automatic retries occur in the background.

If the user lacks sufficient credits when starting an ingestion or a query, a dialog appears informing them that their credits are low and provides an option to purchase more before proceeding. The NFT purchase flow handles gas errors by catching failed transactions and prompting the user to increase gas or try again. All fatal errors guide the user to a support link where they can report issues.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the first moment a student or blockchain enthusiast connects their wallet, Study4Me guides them through a seamless journey: minting or verifying an NFT, exploring the dashboard, and creating a study topic by ingesting YouTube videos, documents, images, and webpages. Each study topic transforms into a Knowledge Graph that users can navigate, query, and enrich with synthesized audio classes. Settings and analytics provide full control over credits, notifications, and usage metrics. When errors occur, clear messages and retry options keep the user on track. Whether a user wants a quick answer, a visual map of ideas, or an offline MP3 summary, Study4Me connects every feature into a single, cohesive learning experience.
