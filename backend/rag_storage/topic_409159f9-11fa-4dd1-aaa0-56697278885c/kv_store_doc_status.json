your host Sean Ian's in today's video we'll be answering the question video we'll be answering the question video we'll be answering the question what is a graph and we're talking about what is a graph and we're talking about what is a graph and we're talking about graph theory graphs so you might have graph theory graphs so you might have graph theory graphs so you might have seen something like this called a graph seen something like this called a graph seen something like this called a graph this is not what we're talking about this is not what we're talking about this is not what we're talking about when we say graph so without further ado when we say graph so without further ado when we say graph so without further ado let's get into the meat of the lesson so let's get into the meat of the lesson so let's get into the meat of the lesson so here is an example of a graph called G here is an example of a graph called G here is an example of a graph called G and what makes up this graph of course and what makes up this graph of course and what makes up this graph of course the whole point of the video is to the whole point of the video is to the whole point of the video is to answer the question what is a graph so answer the question what is a graph so answer the question what is a graph so what do we see here what is this graph what do we see here what is this graph what do we see here what is this graph made of well it's made of two types of made of well it's made of two types of made of well it's made of two types of objects it's made of these things called objects it's made of these things called objects it's made of these things called vertices and these things here that vertices and these things here that vertices and these things here that connect pairs of vertices called edges connect pairs of vertices called edges connect pairs of vertices called edges so just to reiterate those black circles so just to reiterate those black circles so just to reiterate those black circles are called vertices they're often called are called vertices they're often called are called vertices they're often called nodes also but we're going to call them nodes also but we're going to call them nodes also but we're going to call them vertices and the blue lines that join vertices and the blue lines that join vertices and the blue lines that join pairs of vertices are called edges and pairs of vertices are called edges and pairs of vertices are called edges and before going any further I also want to before going any further I also want to before going any further I also want to mention that what we're talking about mention that what we're talking about mention that what we're talking about today is called today is called today is called a simple graph and I don't want to spend a simple graph and I don't want to spend a simple graph and I don't want to spend too much time on this but to make it too much time on this but to make it too much time on this but to make it clear as quickly as I can this is called clear as quickly as I can this is called clear as quickly as I can this is called the simple graph because this isn't the simple graph because this isn't the simple graph because this isn't allowed this isn't allowed and this allowed this isn't allowed and this allowed this isn't allowed and this isn't allowed so this what I drew here isn't allowed so this what I drew here isn't allowed so this what I drew here is a loop it's an edge from one vertex is a loop it's an edge from one vertex is a loop it's an edge from one vertex to itself that's not allowed in a simple to itself that's not allowed in a simple to itself that's not allowed in a simple graph here what I drew is multiple edges graph here what I drew is multiple edges graph here what I drew is multiple edges joining the same pair of vertices one joining the same pair of vertices one joining the same pair of vertices one edge to edge two edges are not allowed edge to edge two edges are not allowed edge to edge two edges are not allowed to join the same pair of vertices in a to join the same pair of vertices in a to join the same pair of vertices in a simple graph and then lastly this head simple graph and then lastly this head simple graph and then lastly this head Arrowhead that I put there is giving Arrowhead that I put there is giving Arrowhead that I put there is giving direction to this blue edge edges in direction to this blue edge edges in direction to this blue edge edges in simple graphs don't have direction now simple graphs don't have direction now simple graphs don't have direction now with that lightening lesson on simple with that lightening lesson on simple with that lightening lesson on simple graphs out of the way let's continue graphs out of the way let's continue graphs out of the way let's continue talking about simple graphs which were talking about simple graphs which were talking about simple graphs which were usually just called graphs so this is usually just called graphs so this is usually just called graphs so this is all fine and dandy but what is a formal all fine and dandy but what is a formal all fine and dandy but what is a formal definition of a graph because that's definition of a graph because that's definition of a graph because that's really what we want really what we want really what we want well a graph that we'll call G of course well a graph that we'll call G of course well a graph that we'll call G of course is an ordered pair with some vertex set is an ordered pair with some vertex set is an ordered pair with some vertex set that will call V and some edge set that that will call V and some edge set that that will call V and some edge set that we'll call E and like I said it's an we'll call E and like I said it's an we'll call E and like I said it's an ordered pair so it's important that the ordered pair so it's important that the ordered pair so it's important that the vertex set comes first and then the edge vertex set comes first and then the edge vertex set comes first and then the edge set comes second so if we wanted to set comes second so if we wanted to set comes second so if we wanted to write out this graph up here in this way write out this graph up here in this way write out this graph up here in this way how would we how would we how would we do it well right now we can't because we do it well right now we can't because we do it well right now we can't because we haven't labeled the vertices or edges in haven't labeled the vertices or edges in haven't labeled the vertices or edges in this graph it's currently unlabeled so this graph it's currently unlabeled so this graph it's currently unlabeled so without any names to put to the vertices without any names to put to the vertices without any names to put to the vertices or edges we can't write it out or edges we can't write it out or edges we can't write it out explicitly with all of its vertices and explicitly with all of its vertices and explicitly with all of its vertices and edges in this form and sometimes this is edges in this form and sometimes this is edges in this form and sometimes this is fine sometimes all we want is this fine sometimes all we want is this fine sometimes all we want is this visual representation of a graph and visual representation of a graph and visual representation of a graph and that's really what you want to look at that's really what you want to look at that's really what you want to look at the graphs structure but for the sake of the graphs structure but for the sake of the graphs structure but for the sake of this lesson we're going to throw some this lesson we're going to throw some this lesson we're going to throw some labels down so we'll call this vertex 1 labels down so we'll call this vertex 1 labels down so we'll call this vertex 1 this one 2 and this one 3 and this one 4 this one 2 and this one 3 and this one 4 this one 2 and this one 3 and this one 4 hope you can read those numbers all hope you can read those numbers all hope you can read those numbers all right so then if we want to write the right so then if we want to write the right so then if we want to write the graph out in this form how do we do it graph out in this form how do we do it graph out in this form how do we do it well I'm going to erase this so that we well I'm going to erase this so that we well I'm going to erase this so that we have some more room to write it out and have some more room to write it out and have some more room to write it out and let's start so G again is an ordered let's start so G again is an ordered let's start so G again is an ordered pair so we open up the ordered pair and pair so we open up the ordered pair and pair so we open up the ordered pair and then the vertex set comes first so we then the vertex set comes first so we then the vertex set comes first so we open up the vertex set and what do we open up the vertex set and what do we open up the vertex set and what do we put in it well of course we put in the put in it well of course we put in the put in it well of course we put in the vertices 1 2 3 and 4 those are the 4 vertices 1 2 3 and 4 those are the 4 vertices 1 2 3 and 4 those are the 4 vertices in the graph G so those are the vertices in the graph G so those are the vertices in the graph G so those are the 4 objects that go in the vertex set then 4 objects that go in the vertex set then 4 objects that go in the vertex set then comes the edge set the edge set is a comes the edge set the edge set is a comes the edge set the edge set is a little trickier it's comprised of 2 little trickier it's comprised of 2 little trickier it's comprised of 2 element subsets of the vertex set the element subsets of the vertex set the element subsets of the vertex set the two elements that go into each subset two elements that go into each subset two elements that go into each subset are vertices that are joined by an edge are vertices that are joined by an edge are vertices that are joined by an edge and I know that might be a little and I know that might be a little and I know that might be a little unclear so let's just look at an example unclear so let's just look at an example unclear so let's just look at an example here we have an edge joining vertex 1 here we have an edge joining vertex 1 here we have an edge joining vertex 1 and 2 so to represent that in the edge and 2 so to represent that in the edge and 2 so to represent that in the edge set we write a set that has the vertices set we write a set that has the vertices set we write a set that has the vertices 1 and 2 in it and that's all there is 1 and 2 in it and that's all there is 1 and 2 in it and that's all there is you could also write it as the set you could also write it as the set you could also write it as the set containing 2 1 containing 2 1 containing 2 1 remember that doesn't matter because remember that doesn't matter because remember that doesn't matter because sets are not ordered so then 2 is joined sets are not ordered so then 2 is joined sets are not ordered so then 2 is joined with 3 so we also have to write the edge with 3 so we also have to write the edge with 3 so we also have to write the edge 2 3 in there and again you could write 2 3 in there and again you could write 2 3 in there and again you could write it as 3 2 doesn't matter the order of it as 3 2 doesn't matter the order of it as 3 2 doesn't matter the order of the vertices doesn't matter all that the vertices doesn't matter all that the vertices doesn't matter all that matters is that they're joined by an matters is that they're joined by an matters is that they're joined by an edge and I'll go ahead and write the edge and I'll go ahead and write the edge and I'll go ahead and write the rest of these out so here we go this is rest of these out so here we go this is rest of these out so here we go this is the graph G written out explicitly as an the graph G written out explicitly as an the graph G written out explicitly as an ordered pair with this vertex set and ordered pair with this vertex set and ordered pair with this vertex set and this edge set and you can see all the this edge set and you can see all the this edge set and you can see all the edges here in the set so we already went edges here in the set so we already went edges here in the set so we already went over 1 2 which was right there over 1 2 which was right there over 1 2 which was right there and 2/3 which was right there I just and 2/3 which was right there I just and 2/3 which was right there I just rewrote it so that it would fit more rewrote it so that it would fit more rewrote it so that it would fit more nicely and let's look at the other edges nicely and let's look at the other edges nicely and let's look at the other edges 1 & 3 are joined by an edge we see that 1 & 3 are joined by an edge we see that 1 & 3 are joined by an edge we see that represented there 2 & 4 are joined by an represented there 2 & 4 are joined by an represented there 2 & 4 are joined by an edge we see that represented there 3 & 4 edge we see that represented there 3 & 4 edge we see that represented there 3 & 4 that's right there and 1 in 4 right that's right there and 1 in 4 right that's right there and 1 in 4 right there and I wrote all of these with the there and I wrote all of these with the there and I wrote all of these with the lower numbered vertex first and the lower numbered vertex first and the lower numbered vertex first and the higher numbered vertex second I just higher numbered vertex second I just higher numbered vertex second I just want to make sure it's absolutely clear want to make sure it's absolutely clear want to make sure it's absolutely clear that is not important that is not important that is not important you could write all of these edge sets you could write all of these edge sets you could write all of these edge sets in reverse order so 2 1 3 1 4 1 3 2 that in reverse order so 2 1 3 1 4 1 3 2 that in reverse order so 2 1 3 1 4 1 3 2 that does not matter does not matter does not matter again all that matters in the edge set again all that matters in the edge set again all that matters in the edge set is that the vertices you've list in is that the vertices you've list in is that the vertices you've list in these subsets are joined by an edge and these subsets are joined by an edge and these subsets are joined by an edge and I'll also mention that in this case this I'll also mention that in this case this I'll also mention that in this case this graph G that we see here is an example graph G that we see here is an example graph G that we see here is an example of a complete graph because every pair of a complete graph because every pair of a complete graph because every pair of vertices is joined by an edge and if of vertices is joined by an edge and if of vertices is joined by an edge and if in a graph every pair of vertices is in a graph every pair of vertices is in a graph every pair of vertices is joined by an edge we call it a complete joined by an edge we call it a complete joined by an edge we call it a complete graph but I'll talk more about those in graph but I'll talk more about those in graph but I'll talk more about those in a different lesson now one other thing I a different lesson now one other thing I a different lesson now one other thing I want to touch on is the visual want to touch on is the visual want to touch on is the visual representations of a graph so like I representations of a graph so like I representations of a graph so like I said a graph is an ordered pair with a said a graph is an ordered pair with a said a graph is an ordered pair with a vertex and an edge set that's a formal vertex and an edge set that's a formal vertex and an edge set that's a formal definition of a graph but we can also definition of a graph but we can also definition of a graph but we can also draw them like you see here and let's draw them like you see here and let's draw them like you see here and let's name these graphs so this one is G and name these graphs so this one is G and name these graphs so this one is G and this one is whoops that was a bad H this this one is whoops that was a bad H this this one is whoops that was a bad H this one is H the point I want to make here one is H the point I want to make here one is H the point I want to make here is that while these graphs look is that while these graphs look is that while these graphs look different this one is the one we just different this one is the one we just different this one is the one we just talked about and this one looks talked about and this one looks talked about and this one looks different they are in fact the same different they are in fact the same different they are in fact the same graph you can draw any graph in an graph you can draw any graph in an graph you can draw any graph in an infinite number of ways but what's infinite number of ways but what's infinite number of ways but what's important is what vertices and edges it important is what vertices and edges it important is what vertices and edges it has so two graphs are equal if they have has so two graphs are equal if they have has so two graphs are equal if they have the same vertex set and the same edge the same vertex set and the same edge the same vertex set and the same edge set so are these graphs here equal set so are these graphs here equal set so are these graphs here equal indeed they are and how do we know well indeed they are and how do we know well indeed they are and how do we know well like I said we know they're equal if like I said we know they're equal if like I said we know they're equal if they have the same vertex and edge sets they have the same vertex and edge sets they have the same vertex and edge sets so let's go through it graph G has so let's go through it graph G has so let's go through it graph G has vertices 1 2 3 & 4 graph H similarly has vertices 1 2 3 & 4 graph H similarly has vertices 1 2 3 & 4 graph H similarly has vertices 1 2 3 & 4 then we just have to vertices 1 2 3 & 4 then we just have to vertices 1 2 3 & 4 then we just have to look at the edges 1 is joined with 2 1 look at the edges 1 is joined with 2 1 look at the edges 1 is joined with 2 1 is joined with 2 2 with 3 2 or 3 whoops is joined with 2 2 with 3 2 or 3 whoops is joined with 2 2 with 3 2 or 3 whoops that was bad 2 with 3 3 that was bad 2 with 3 3 that was bad 2 with 3 3 joined with four we see threes joined joined with four we see threes joined joined with four we see threes joined with four over there with four over there with four over there one is joined with four and one is one is joined with four and one is one is joined with four and one is joined with four over here and then we joined with four over here and then we joined with four over here and then we have two four and one 3ng and we also have two four and one 3ng and we also have two four and one 3ng and we also have two four and one three in h so we have two four and one three in h so we have two four and one three in h so we see clearly there that these grass g and see clearly there that these grass g and see clearly there that these grass g and h have the same vertex and edge sets h have the same vertex and edge sets h have the same vertex and edge sets thus we can say that G is equal to H so thus we can say that G is equal to H so thus we can say that G is equal to H so again you can draw graphs to look again you can draw graphs to look again you can draw graphs to look totally different when they might in totally different when they might in totally different when they might in fact be the same graph just as another fact be the same graph just as another fact be the same graph just as another example let's say we add these two example let's say we add these two example let's say we add these two vertices vertex one and two we could vertices vertex one and two we could vertices vertex one and two we could join them with an edge like that and join them with an edge like that and join them with an edge like that and that's a fine graph and that graph is that's a fine graph and that graph is that's a fine graph and that graph is indeed the same as this graph where one indeed the same as this graph where one indeed the same as this graph where one and two are joined by this ridiculous and two are joined by this ridiculous and two are joined by this ridiculous edge all that makes them equal is that edge all that makes them equal is that edge all that makes them equal is that they have the same vertex set one and they have the same vertex set one and they have the same vertex set one and two and the same edge set namely an edge two and the same edge set namely an edge two and the same edge set namely an edge joining one in two I know it looks like joining one in two I know it looks like joining one in two I know it looks like a mess but I hope the point is clear one a mess but I hope the point is clear one a mess but I hope the point is clear one other thing I want to talk about is the other thing I want to talk about is the other thing I want to talk about is the empty graph what is the empty graph well empty graph what is the empty graph well empty graph what is the empty graph well an empty graph is any graph that has an an empty graph is any graph that has an an empty graph is any graph that has an empty edge set so it's an ordered pair empty edge set so it's an ordered pair empty edge set so it's an ordered pair with some vertex set and an empty edge with some vertex set and an empty edge with some vertex set and an empty edge set so a graph like this or like this or set so a graph like this or like this or set so a graph like this or like this or like this like this like this it has vertices but no edges that is it has vertices but no edges that is it has vertices but no edges that is allowed it's perfectly fine and we call allowed it's perfectly fine and we call allowed it's perfectly fine and we call such graphs empty graphs such graphs empty graphs such graphs empty graphs the only other sort of tricky bit is the only other sort of tricky bit is the only other sort of tricky bit is that if the graph has no vertices either that if the graph has no vertices either that if the graph has no vertices either so if it has an empty vertex set and an so if it has an empty vertex set and an so if it has an empty vertex set and an empty edge set whoops I don't know why I empty edge set whoops I don't know why I empty edge set whoops I don't know why I wrote that extra comma so an empty wrote that extra comma so an empty wrote that extra comma so an empty vertex and an empty edge set this is vertex and an empty edge set this is vertex and an empty edge set this is sometimes considered a graph and sometimes considered a graph and sometimes considered a graph and sometimes not it depends on the author sometimes not it depends on the author sometimes not it depends on the author and the text so just be aware that this and the text so just be aware that this and the text so just be aware that this could be considered a graph or not could be considered a graph or not could be considered a graph or not considered a graph depending on what considered a graph depending on what considered a graph depending on what you're reading if it is considered a you're reading if it is considered a you're reading if it is considered a graph it's sometimes referred to graph it's sometimes referred to graph it's sometimes referred to specifically as the null graph which is specifically as the null graph which is specifically as the null graph which is the empty graph but with zero vertices the empty graph but with zero vertices the empty graph but with zero vertices and then lastly let's just look at an and then lastly let's just look at an and then lastly let's just look at an example with some words so this is an example with some words so this is an example with some words so this is an example of how a graph can represent example of how a graph can represent example of how a graph can represent objects and how the objects are related objects and how the objects are related objects and how the objects are related and that's really what graphs and that's really what graphs and that's really what graphs are all about so let's say Alice Bob are all about so let's say Alice Bob are all about so let's say Alice Bob Cody Dan Eric and Fred six intrepid Cody Dan Eric and Fred six intrepid Cody Dan Eric and Fred six intrepid heroes are going to a hootenanny a party heroes are going to a hootenanny a party heroes are going to a hootenanny a party a Fiesta they're going to have a good a Fiesta they're going to have a good a Fiesta they're going to have a good time and at this most celebratory event time and at this most celebratory event time and at this most celebratory event they are shaking hands and we want to they are shaking hands and we want to they are shaking hands and we want to write a graph draw a graph that write a graph draw a graph that write a graph draw a graph that represents the people at the party and represents the people at the party and represents the people at the party and who has shaken hands well we've got our who has shaken hands well we've got our who has shaken hands well we've got our objects over here the names of the objects over here the names of the objects over here the names of the partygoers and we have their relations partygoers and we have their relations partygoers and we have their relations over here which are the pairs of people over here which are the pairs of people over here which are the pairs of people who have shaken hands so how are we who have shaken hands so how are we who have shaken hands so how are we going to draw our graph well to begin going to draw our graph well to begin going to draw our graph well to begin with we need the vertices which with we need the vertices which with we need the vertices which represent all of the objects in this represent all of the objects in this represent all of the objects in this situation in particular it represents situation in particular it represents situation in particular it represents the people so I've labeled each vertex the people so I've labeled each vertex the people so I've labeled each vertex with the first letter of the partygoers with the first letter of the partygoers with the first letter of the partygoers names and now all that's left for the names and now all that's left for the names and now all that's left for the edges is to join the people who have edges is to join the people who have edges is to join the people who have shaken hands so I'll write the edges in shaken hands so I'll write the edges in shaken hands so I'll write the edges in blue we see the Alice shook Eric and blue we see the Alice shook Eric and blue we see the Alice shook Eric and Fred's hands so we have to join a with Fred's hands so we have to join a with Fred's hands so we have to join a with the Ivar Tex and with the F vertex we the Ivar Tex and with the F vertex we the Ivar Tex and with the F vertex we see that Bob and Cody shook hands so we see that Bob and Cody shook hands so we see that Bob and Cody shook hands so we can join the Bob vertex with the Cody can join the Bob vertex with the Cody can join the Bob vertex with the Cody vertex and Fred shook Bob and Eric's vertex and Fred shook Bob and Eric's vertex and Fred shook Bob and Eric's hands so we will join F with the B hands so we will join F with the B hands so we will join F with the B vertex and we will join F with the a vertex and we will join F with the a vertex and we will join F with the a vertex and that's just an example of how vertex and that's just an example of how vertex and that's just an example of how easily we can use a graph to represent easily we can use a graph to represent easily we can use a graph to represent objects and how they relate to each objects and how they relate to each objects and how they relate to each other it's a very classic often used other it's a very classic often used other it's a very classic often used graph theory example but I think it's a graph theory example but I think it's a graph theory example but I think it's a good one because it doesn't leave much good one because it doesn't leave much good one because it doesn't leave much room for confusion so again a graph is room for confusion so again a graph is room for confusion so again a graph is just an ordered pair with vertices and just an ordered pair with vertices and just an ordered pair with vertices and edges the ordered pair has a vertex set edges the ordered pair has a vertex set edges the ordered pair has a vertex set and then it has an edge set we see our and then it has an edge set we see our and then it has an edge set we see our vertices here are these black circles vertices here are these black circles vertices here are these black circles and the edges are the blue lines that and the edges are the blue lines that and the edges are the blue lines that join pairs of vertices I could go on join pairs of vertices I could go on join pairs of vertices I could go on there's lots of great stuff to talk there's lots of great stuff to talk there's lots of great stuff to talk about with graph theory but I think about with graph theory but I think about with graph theory but I think that's enough for today we'll go over that's enough for today we'll go over that's enough for today we'll go over lots of other graph theory stuff in lots of other graph theory stuff in lots of other graph theory stuff in other lessons so I hope this video other lessons so I hope this video other lessons so I hope this video helped you understand what a graph is helped you understand what a graph is helped you understand what a graph is let me know in the comments if

This is where you'll configure most of the plugin's capabilities.\n\nonunload() runs when the plugin is disabled. Any resources that your plugin is using must be released here to avoid affecting the performance of Obsidian after your plugin has been disabled.\n\nTo better understand when these methods are called, you can print a message to the console whenever the plugin loads and unloads. The console is a valuable tool that lets developers monitor the status of their code.\n\nTo view the console:\n\n- 1 . Toggle the Developer Tools by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I in Windows and Linux, or Cmd-Option-I on macOS.\n- 2 . Click on the Console tab in the Developer Tools window.\n\n## INTERACTIVE GRAPH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ON THIS PAGE\n\nPlugin lifecycle",
