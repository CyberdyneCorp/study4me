it's made of these things called objects it's made of these things called objects it's made of these things called vertices and these things here that vertices and these things here that vertices and

simple graphs out of the way let's continue graphs out of the way let's continue graphs out of the way let's continue talking about simple graphs which were talking about simple graphs which were talking about simple graphs which were usually just called graphs so this is usually just called graphs so this is usually just called graphs so this is all fine and dandy but what is a formal all fine and dandy but what is a formal all fine and dandy but what is a formal definition of a graph because that's definition of a graph because that's definition of a graph because that's really what we want really what we want really what we want well a graph that we'll call G of course well a graph that we'll call G of course well a graph that we'll call G of course is an ordered pair with some vertex set is an ordered pair with some vertex set is an ordered pair with some vertex set that will call V and some edge set that that will call V and some edge set that that will call V and some edge set that we'll call E and like I said it's an we'll call E and like I said it's an we'll call E and like I said it's an ordered pair so it's important that the ordered pair so it's important that the ordered pair so it's important that the vertex set comes first and then the edge vertex set comes first and then the edge vertex set comes first and then the edge set comes second so if we wanted to set comes second so if we wanted to set comes second so if we wanted to write out this graph up here in this way write out this graph up here in this way write out this graph up here in this way how would we how would we how would we do it well right now we can't because we do it well right now we can't because we do it well right now we can't because we haven't labeled the vertices or edges in haven't labeled the vertices or edges in haven't labeled the vertices or edges in this graph it's currently unlabeled so this graph it's currently unlabeled so this graph it's currently unlabeled so without any names to put to the vertices without any names to put to the vertices without any names to put to the vertices or edges we can't write it out or edges we can't write it out or edges we can't write it out explicitly with all of its vertices and explicitly with all of its vertices and explicitly with all of its vertices and edges in this form and sometimes this is edges in this form and sometimes this is edges in this form and sometimes this is fine sometimes all we want is this fine sometimes all we want is this fine sometimes all we want is this visual representation of a graph and visual representation of a graph and visual representation of a graph and that's really what you want to look at that's really what you want to look at that's really what you want to look at the graphs structure but for the sake of the graphs structure but for the sake of the graphs structure but for the sake of this lesson we're going to throw some this lesson we're going to throw some this lesson we're going to throw some labels down so we'll call this vertex 1 labels down so we'll call this vertex 1 labels down so we'll call this vertex 1 this one 2 and this one 3 and this one 4 this one 2 and this one 3 and this one 4 this one 2 and this one 3 and this one 4 hope you can read those numbers all hope you can read those numbers all hope you can read those numbers all right so then if we want to write the right so then if we want to write the right so then if we want to write the graph out in this form how do we do it graph out in this form how do we do it graph out in this form how do we do it well I'm going to erase this so that we well I'm going to erase this so that we well I'm going to erase this so that we have some more room to write it out and have some more room to write it out and have some more room to write it out and let's start so G again is an ordered let's start so G again is an ordered let's start so G again is an ordered pair so we open up the ordered pair and pair so we open up the ordered pair and pair so we open up the ordered pair and then the vertex set comes first so we then the vertex set comes first so we then the vertex set comes first so we open up the vertex set and what do we open up the vertex set and what do we open up the vertex set and what do we put in it well of course we put in the put in it well of course we put in the put in it well of course we put in the vertices 1 2 3 and 4 those are the 4 vertices 1 2 3 and 4 those are the 4 vertices 1 2 3\n######################\nOutput:"

that's left for the edges is to join the people who have edges is to join the people who have edges is to join the people who have shaken hands so I'll write the edges in shaken hands so I'll write the edges in shaken hands so I'll write the edges in blue we see the Alice shook Eric and blue we see the Alice shook Eric and blue we see the Alice shook Eric and Fred's hands so we have to join a

that Bob and Cody shook hands so we see that Bob and Cody shook hands so we see that Bob and Cody shook hands so we can join the Bob vertex with the Cody can join the Bob vertex with the Cody can join the Bob vertex with the Cody vertex and Fred shook Bob and Eric's vertex and Fred shook Bob and Eric's vertex and Fred shook Bob and Eric's hands so we will join F with the B hands so we will join F with the B hands so we will join F with the B vertex and we will join F with the a vertex and we will join F with the a vertex and we will join F with the a vertex and that's just an example of how vertex and that's just an example of how vertex and that's just an example of how easily we can use a graph to represent easily we can use a graph to represent easily we can use a graph to represent

// Configure resources needed by the plugin. } async onunload() { // Release any resources configured by the plugin. } }\n```\n\n## Plugin lifecycle\n\nonload() runs whenever the user starts using the plugin in Obsidian. This is where you'll configure most of the plugin's capabilities.\n\nonunload() runs when the plugin is disabled. Any resources that your plugin is using must be released here to avoid affecting the performance of Obsidian after your plugin has been disabled.\n\nTo better understand when these methods are called, you can print a message to the console whenever the plugin loads and unloads. The console is a valuable tool that lets developers monitor the status of their code.\n\nTo view the console:\n\n- 1 .
